# Problem Statement:
Two Python-based codes were developed to process the raw images to detect, identify and count the particles and upload the data to a spreadsheet.

# Motivation:
The number of GitHub repositories dedicated to image processing algorithms is limited, and even fewer of them address the challenging task of detecting particles from raw images with significant background noise. To support our fellow researchers across various fields, who often encounter the need to process and analyze raw image data, we have decided to share an image processing algorithm that effectively removes background noise from raw images and accurately detects and counts particles within the image.
